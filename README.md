This repository contains a Java application for managing employees in a company, demonstrating the use of inheritance and polymorphism.

# User Story: Implement Employee Hierarchy System
## Description:
As a Java developer, I need to implement an employee hierarchy system in our HR management software, where different types of employees inherit properties and behaviors from a base Employee class.

## Tasks:

1. Define a base class Employee with common attributes like name, id, and salary, along with methods for displaying employee information.
2. Create subclasses Manager and RegularEmployee inheriting from the Employee class, with additional attributes and methods specific to each type of employee.
3. Implement methods for calculating and displaying the total salary of all employees and identifying the highest-paid employee.
4. Use inheritance to leverage code reusability and maintain a clear hierarchy in the employee management system.
